# English-to-Urdu Translation using RNN and LSTM 🌍➡️🇵🇰

## Overview
This project implements many-to-many RNN and LSTM models for **English-to-Urdu** translation using the **parallel-corpus.xlsx** dataset. It addresses the limitations of RNNs, such as handling long sequences and capturing dependencies.

## Features ✨
- **Data Preparation**: Preprocesses English and Urdu sentences and splits the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Model Implementation**: Builds and trains both RNN and LSTM architectures for translation tasks.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses BLEU score and accuracy to evaluate model performance.
- **Performance Comparison**: Compares the effectiveness of RNN and LSTM in translating English to Urdu.

## Challenges & Limitations ⚠️
- RNN Limitations: Difficulty handling long sequences and capturing long-term dependencies.
- LSTM Improvements: Discusses how LSTM mitigates RNN limitations while acknowledging remaining challenges.
